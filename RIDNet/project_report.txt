Introduction

For my part of the project, I developed and implemented the Residual Image Denoising Network (RIDNet), an advanced deep learning architecture designed to tackle the problem of image denoising. The primary objective of this project was to clean noisy X-ray images while preserving the fine details critical for medical analysis. This report outlines the implementation process, training pipeline, results, and key learnings.

Project Details

Architecture: RIDNet is a convolutional neural network specifically designed for image denoising. The network architecture consists of three main components:

    1. Head: A convolutional layer that maps a single-channel input image (grayscale) to 64 feature maps.
    2. Body: A series of three residual dense blocks (RDBs), each comprising four convolutional layers interleaved with ReLU activation functions. These blocks enable deep feature extraction and enhance learning efficiency.
    3. Tail: A convolutional layer that reduces the feature maps back to a single-channel image. A skip connection is used between the input and the output, allowing the network to learn the residual mapping.

Dataset: I used the NIH Chest X-Ray from the Google Cloud Healthcare API. This dataset has approximately 100,000 images. Due to time and resource constraints, I was only able to use 10,000 of those images. I then divided it into training and testing subsets. The input images were grayscale X-rays, which were augmented and converted to tensors during preprocessing.


Training Pipeline: The training script utilized the following:

    * Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE) to measure the pixel-wise error between denoised and clean images.
    * Optimizer: Adam optimizer for adaptive learning rate adjustments.
    * Hyperparameters: Batch size of 32, learning rate of 0.001, and 50 epochs.

Evaluation Metric: The Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) was chosen as the evaluation metric, which measures the reconstruction quality of the denoised images. Higher PSNR indicates better performance.

Results

Training Process: The training process was conducted over 50 epochs. Here are key observations:

    * The loss consistently decreased across epochs, demonstrating effective learning.
    * At epoch 50, the training loss reached near-zero levels (e.g., Epoch [50/50], Loss: 0.0000).

Testing and Accuracy: During testing, the average PSNR achieved was:
    * First Test Run: 48.99 dB
    * Second Test Run: 55.31 dB

These results indicate that RIDNet performed exceptionally well in reconstructing clean images from noisy inputs. The improvement in PSNR between runs highlights the robustness of the model after iterative refinements.

Key Insights
    1. Model Performance: The use of RDBs and skip connections facilitated efficient feature extraction and residual learning, leading to superior performance compared to simpler denoising models.
    2. Challenges Encountered:
       * Balancing computational complexity with performance required careful tuning of model parameters.
       * Generating accurate PSNR scores necessitated precise preprocessing and evaluation techniques.
    3. Future Work:
       * Incorporating advanced techniques such as attention mechanisms could further enhance performance.
       * Expanding the dataset to include diverse noise patterns would make the model more generalizable.

Conclusion

In this project, I successfully implemented and trained RIDNet for X-ray image denoising. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the model in achieving high-quality image restoration, which could have practical implications in medical imaging and other domains requiring precise image reconstruction.
This project has deepened my understanding of convolutional neural networks and their applications in image processing tasks. Moving forward, I am eager to explore further advancements in denoising algorithms and their deployment in real-world scenarios.
