## X-Ray Denoising

This is a project that employs three separate approaches to de-noising X-Ray images. Each approach works slightly differently, so there is a README provided in each folder for each individual approach.

See Autoencoder/README.md
See Pyramid Approach/README.md
See RIDNet/README.md
